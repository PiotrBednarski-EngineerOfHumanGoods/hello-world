# hello-world
Hello, my name is Piotr and I come from Poland. 
I am interested in cybernetics, bioengineering, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
My goal is to help people by creating new technologies that will make their everyday lives easier.
I want to extend the age to which a person can live.
I think it is possible and necessary.
